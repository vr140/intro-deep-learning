    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: You do not have to learn all of this math in order to be successful at deep learning. I encourage you to skip to the next notebook and come back here. The math is useful to understand gradient descent and regularization in this notebook and backpropagation in the next notebook. Also, if you take time to understand, it will get you feeling comfortable enough to read deep learning posts and possibly even academic papers for new ideas.**\n",

    "A _vector_ is technically defined as something that has a magnitude and direction (in contrast to a _scalar_, which is just a number and only has magnitude).

You can have a vector of scalars, vector of variables, vector of functions, and even vector of vectors!**\n",
