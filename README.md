# intro-deep-learning
Deep learning is an exciting topic in artificial intelligence. It has a lot of mystique surrounding it that can make it hard to understand what it entails. The goal of this project is to aggregate the best resources and provide introductory deep learning tutorials in the form of Jupyter Notebooks. The content will be explained as simply as possible, and the intended audience is anyone who has prior programming experience and interest in machine learning. I'm a deep learning hobbyist, and I hope that by putting together through these notebooks, I can more deeply (pun intended) understand concepts along the way and help you learn as well.

## What you need to get started

For these notebooks, you'll need to be able to code in Python. If you are unfamiliar with Python, I suggest starting with:
