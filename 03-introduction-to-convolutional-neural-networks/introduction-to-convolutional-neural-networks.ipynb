    "### 1. What is a convolutional neural network?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that each neuron \"receives some inputs, performs a dot product and optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image pixels on one end to class scores at the other. And they still have a loss function (e.g. SVM/Softmax) on the last (fully-connected) layer and all the tips/tricks we developed for learning regular Neural Networks still apply.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What changes with a convolutional neural net, also known as ConvNet or CNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"ConvNet architectures make the explicit assumption that the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties into the architecture. These then make the forward function more efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in the network.\" [8]\n",

    "That's all we need to know for now! We'll get into what a convolution does later."
