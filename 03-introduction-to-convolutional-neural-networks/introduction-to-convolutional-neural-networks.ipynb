    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that each neuron \"receives some inputs, performs a dot product and optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image pixels on one end to class scores at the other. And they still have a loss function (e.g. SVM/Softmax) on the last (fully-connected) layer and all the tips/tricks we developed for learning regular Neural Networks still apply.\"\n",

    "What changes with a convolutional neural net, also known as ConvNet or CNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"ConvNet architectures make the explicit assumption that the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties into the architecture. These then make the forward function more efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in the network.\" [8]\n",

    "\"In this section you can experiment with whatever ConvNet architecture you'd like on CIFAR-10.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should experiment with architectures, hyperparameters, loss functions, regularization, or anything else you can think of to train a model that achieves **at least 70%** accuracy on the **validation** set within 10 epochs. You can use the `check_accuracy` and `train` functions from above, or you can implement your own training loop.\n",

    "### Some things you can try:\n",
    "- **Filter size**: Above we used 5x5 and 3x3; is this optimal?\n",
    "- **Number of filters**: Above we used 16 and 32 filters. Would more or fewer do better?\n",
    "- **Pooling**: We didn't use any pooling above. Would this improve the model?\n",
    "- **Normalization**: Would your model be improved with batch normalization, layer normalization, group normalization, or some other normalization strategy?\n",
    "- **Network architecture**: The ConvNet above has only three layers of trainable parameters. Would a deeper model do better?\n",
    "- **Global average pooling**: Instead of flattening after the final convolutional layer, would global average pooling do better? This strategy is used for example in Google's Inception network and in Residual Networks.\n",
    "- **Regularization**: Would some kind of regularization improve performance? Maybe weight decay or dropout?\n",

    "### WARNING: Batch Normalization / Dropout\n",
    "Batch Normalization and Dropout **WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY** if you use the `train_keras()` function with the object-oriented `tf.keras.Model` or `tf.keras.Sequential` APIs; if you want to use these layers with this training loop then you **must use the tf.layers functional API**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice both `tf.keras` and `tf` provide higher-level APIs which handle the training loop for you, such as [keras.fit](https://keras.io/models/sequential/) and [tf.Estimator](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/estimators), both of which will properly handle batch normalization when using the object-oriented API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for training\n",
    "For each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and other hyperparameters. When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n",
    "- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n",
    "- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n",
    "- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\" [9]\n",
