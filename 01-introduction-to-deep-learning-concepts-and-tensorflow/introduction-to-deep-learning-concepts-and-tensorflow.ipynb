    "A vector is technically defined as something that has a magnitude and direction (in contrast to a scalar, which is just a number and only has magnitude). For the purposes of this notebook, a vector will represent a vertical _array_ of numbers, with dimensions n x 1 (or n rows and 1 column):\n",

    "Let's write these out in Python using Tensorflow, a library that was built by Google for deep learning. Tensorflow is extremely popular and will be the main programming focus of the rest of these notebooks (in the last lesson, we briefly used numpy, a numerical computation library). NOTE: Other popular libraries include Pytorch and Caffe2. Keras is another popular one but its API has since been absorbed into Tensorflow.  \n"
